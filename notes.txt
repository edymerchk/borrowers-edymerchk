One important item to mention is that if we pass an instance of a friend to link-to, then the
model hook in the Friends Show Route won’t be called. If we want the hook to be called, instead
of doing {{#link-to 'friends.show' friend}}, we’ll have to do {{#link-to 'friends.show'
friend.id}}.

By default, observers are not set up until
the function where they are specified is consumed. We use Ember.on(‘init’, …), which will call the
function as soon as the controller is initialized. This helps us activate the observer.

this.set('a', 2);
this.set('b', 3);

we use Ember.run.once⁶⁴, which guarantees that the function passed will
be called only once during the current running loop. If we set a and b consecutively, the observer
functions is still called twice but the expensive operations just once.
